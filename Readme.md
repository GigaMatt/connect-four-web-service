## About
Built in PHP, the Connect Four Web Service allows a human player to play a game of Connect Four against a machine which features two modes of gameplay: Random and Smart (AI). The goal of the game is to test one's skill against an intelligent system via a simple problem-solving task.

The Connect Four Web Service is a midterm project by Matthew Montoya & Samuel Tinevra for UTEP's Progrmming Languages, CS 3360. Java code provided by Dr. Yoonsik Cheon.
